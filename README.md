<p>
<i>A boilerplate for front-end web apps.</i>
</p>

Web apps are a moving target. The state-of-art for building a Web app
from scratch is ever shifting. It's not that HTML, javascript, and CSS
are changing with much swiftness, but the tools used with them; the
frameworks, builders, and libraries; are constantly on the move and any
it seems any effort to stay current is as big a task as building the 
app itself.

In an effort to bring some sanity back to my infrequent forays into
*from-scratch* Web apps, this project,
Mise-en-place&nbsp;<small>[Mizo&hyphen;n&bullet;plus]</small>,
serves as my moving target.
It moves at its own pace&mdash;slower than the rest&mdash;but catching
up to the state-of-art when it can. This is a &quot;*clone and never 
merge kind of affair*&quot;, so if you choose to use this: **clone it, give it a title, 
and make it your own.** 

### Will Be Using:

   * Node.js
   * Grunt (Other options, but will stick with Grunt for now)
   * Angular
   * As much as possible, vanilla JS (avoiding jQuery)
   * Plain vanilla CSS
   * Karma
   * Git with no scaffolding tools
   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *(All subject to change.)*
        
Running:

    grunt build
    
will create a distribution in a directory external to this project.
