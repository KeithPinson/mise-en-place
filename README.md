# Mise-en-place

<p>
<i>A boilerplate for front-end development.</i>
</p>

Web apps are a moving target. The state-of-art for building a web app
from scratch is ever shifting. It's not that HTML, javascript, and CSS
are changing with much swiftness, but the tools used with them; the
frameworks, builders, and libraries; are constantly on the move and it seems,
any effort to stay current is as big a task as building the app itself.

In an effort to bring some sanity back to my infrequent forays into
*from-scratch* Web apps, this project,
Mise-en-place (which means get everything in place before we start cooking),
serves as my moving target.
It moves at its own pace&mdash;slower than the rest&mdash;but catching
up to the state-of-art when it can. This is a &quot;*clone and never 
merge kind of affair*&quot;, so if you choose to use this: **clone it, give it a title, 
and make it your own.** 

### Will Be Using:

   * Node.js
   * Grunt (Other good options, but will stick with this task-runner)
   * Angular
   * As much as possible, vanilla JS (avoiding jQuery)
   * Plain vanilla CSS
   * Karma
   * Git with no scaffolding tools
   * And a bunch of other stuff, look in [package.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeithPinson/mise-en-place/master/package.json) for clues
   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *(All subject to change.)*
        
Running:

    grunt build
    
will create a distribution in the *dist* folder.
    
        
## Before Starting

   * Be sure to install Node.js, [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
   * Run `npm update -g npm`
   * Install grunt: `npm install -g grunt-cli`
   * Using git make a clone of this project git, clone https:github.com/keithpinson/mise-en-place.git \<myproject\>
   * Run `npm install` to pull in the node modules
